# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please report security issues privately to the maintainers instead of opening a public issue.
- Include a clear description, reproduction steps, and potential impact.
- We’ll acknowledge receipt, investigate, and respond with next steps.

## Guidelines
- Avoid sharing sensitive data in issue trackers.
- If you discover exposed credentials, rotate them immediately and notify maintainers.
- For public deployments, run API calls through a backend proxy to keep provider keys out of the browser.
